# Recommender-system-in-python-project
This is a demo movie recommendation system that I built from scratch myself.

I used a very basic bucketed greedy selection algorithm to find movies. I tried to handle many edge cases (as many as I could think of during development), if I tinker more with this and find more I will make those commits.

I would love if someone tinkers around with this or try to learn how a movie recommendation system works at very elementary level or how UG level LinAlg is used by computers. Obviously it's a very basic system as more advance systems use very advanced algorithms based on various paramenters (user: [past watches, likes, dislikes, watch times], system: [popularity, trending, ratings, awards]) and uses much more advanced LinAlg concepts such as SVD (Singular Value Decomposition).
